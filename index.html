    <h1>Something Random</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, man created pizza. It took seven days and seven nights to perfect the recipe, because finding the balance of sauce, cheese, crust, and toppings was a brutal process. Some lost their lives.</p>
    <p>Luckily for the world, pizza was created, and man realized that it was okay to have different types of sauce, of cheese, of toppings, of crust, and that all pizzas are unique.</p>
    <p>Hail, Pizza!</p>
